# Virtual Assistant using Python, NLP & LLMs ü§ñ

## Overview
This project is a **Python-powered virtual assistant** that combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide intelligent, context-aware conversational support and task execution.

Built as a college/final-year capstone, the assistant can understand spoken or typed input, generate responses using LLMs, and perform actions like web search, reminders, weather lookup, and more.

---

## üéØ Key Features
- **Natural Language Conversation**: Supports voice/text input using speech recognition and text-to-speech.
- **LLM Integration**: Utilizes models like GPT‚Äë4, LLaMA, or OpenAI API for response generation.

## üì• Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/VASU-GATTE/Virtual_Assistant_using_Python-NLP_and_LLMs.git
   cd Virtual_Assistant_using_Python-NLP_and_LLMs


2. **(Optional) Set up Python virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure API keys**

   * Create a `.env` file or update `config.py` with keys such as:

     * `OPENAI_API_KEY`
     * `WEATHER_API_KEY`
     * Optional: other service keys

## üöÄ Usage

To launch the assistant:

```bash
python mod.py
```

or

```bash
python mod.py
```

Then:

* Use **voice input** (speak when prompted) or **type text commands**
* The assistant will process your query via NLP/LLM and respond or act
* Sure! Here's the updated section with example commands tailored to **your college context**:

### üó£Ô∏è Example Commands (College-related)

* **"What is the name of my college?"**
* **"Where is DVR & Dr. HS MIC College of Technology located?"**
* **"Who is the principal of my college?"**
* **"Tell me about the CSE department in my college"**
* **"When does the next semester start?"**
* **"What are the upcoming college events?"**
* **"Show me the academic calendar"**
* **"Open the college website"**
